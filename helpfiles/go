* go *

Usage: go <room/service> [<password on other talker>]

This command moves you to another room which must be linked to your current
one (unless you are a wizard or higher). If the talker is linked to another
you can type the service name to move to the other talker if your password
is the same on the other talker. If it isn't you must supply it as above.

See: move
