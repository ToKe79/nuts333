* wizshout *

Usage: wizshout [<superuser level>] <message>

This command allows superusers to shout to various superuser levels though they
can only specifically shout to levels equal or less that their own. Current
levels supported are WIZ, ARCH and GOD. If no level is specified it defaults
to WIZ which means that all superusers will here it. If for instance the level
is specified as GOD then only users of level GOD will see the message.
