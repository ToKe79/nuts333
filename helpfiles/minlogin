* minlogin *

Usage: minlogin NONE/<user level>

This sets the minimum login level of a user that can log in. This directly
affects the main port but only affects the wiz port if it is set higher than
the wizport login level. If set to NONE then anyone can log in and new users
can be created, if set to NEW no new accounts can be created but users of
level NEW can still log in. If set to USER then only users of level USER and
above can log in and so on...
