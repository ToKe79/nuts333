* charecho *

This is a command that is only of use to people who use character mode
clients. Some of these clients won't echo the characters input themselves
even when told to do so so this command forces the talker to do it instead.
The command is a toggle so using it will alternately flick the echoing on and
off. If you switch echoing on even when your client is echoing you will see
every character twice.
