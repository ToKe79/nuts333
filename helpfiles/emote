* emote *

Usage: emote <text>

Emotes allow you to express emotions. A example would be "Fred feels sad".
If you were logged in as Fred you would enter ".emote feels sad" and your
user name will be prepended to the front. A semi-colon can be used as a
short cut for this command so "; feels sad" would have the same affect as
the above. The result is seen in the room you are currently in.

See: semote, pemote
