* chear *

Usage: chear <room> all/swears/nothing

This sets what part of the conversation in the clones room the clone will
display to you. "all" makes it show all that is being said and emoted , 
"swears" will make it just report swearing (based on the swear_words array
in nuts3xx.h) and nothing will force it to ignore everything.
