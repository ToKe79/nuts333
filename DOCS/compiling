*** Compiling and running the talker ***

I had thought of dividing this version of NUTS up into separate source files
then compiling and linking them together using a makefile but in the end
I decided that it there was very little point as the code isn't that large
and once its compiled its unlikely to be done again unless you decide to
hack it about a bit or move to a different system.
This software was developed in parallel on HP-UX 10.01 using the ANSI compiler 
and Linux 1.2.13 using gcc 2.5.8 so there should be no probs with either of 
these. I have also compiled and run it on SCO 3.2, AIX 3.2 and DYNIX 4.1.3 and 
it seems to work fine though I have not done soak tests on these systems. 

To compile:

Linux & AIX: cc nuts333.c
IRIX & OSF : ditto above?
HP-UX      : cc -Ae nuts333.c  (you need the ANSI compiler)
SCO 3.2    : cc nuts333.c -lsocket -lcrypt_i  
DYNIX 4    : cc nuts333.c -lsocket -lnsl
Solaris    : cc -lsocket -lnsl nuts333.c  (not guaranteed to work)
SunOS 4    : dont even bother unless you have gcc

Running...

The talker comes with a config file ready made (datafiles/config) which will
be a good starting point for you. There are some network addresses in there
but they are more of a guide as to how to set up talker links rather than
being genuine links themselves. 
	To start the talker just type "go" and it will boot and automatically 
run itself in the background. All its actions are written to the syslog file. 
To log in you then just telnet to port 7000 and log in as "fred" with the 
password "test" as this is an account set up with GOD status. The "go" script
assumes the executable is called a.out.

I have included a 2nd config file called config2. This is so you can set up
another talker (by copying the files from this current one) and have them
link together. The only file that need to be different is the config file.
Move config2 into the 2nd datafiles directory as config and run the 2nd 
talker.
