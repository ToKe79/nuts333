*** About clones ***

Clones allow archwizards and gods (as currently set up) to create copies
of themselves in rooms and listen in to and add to the conversation in that
room which will allow them to monitor the proceedings whilst at the same time
being elsewhere , perhaps in a private room having their own private
conversation. The clone commands are fairly straightforward but I will explain
the following ones:

switch - switches you between your current object and one of your clone
	    objects.

clsay - makes a clone say something

clhear - clones send what they hear to their owner but this can be set to 
	    return either all the conversation in their room, only that with
	    swearing or nothing at all (just to be a presence there).
